# React 3D SVG Glass Shape

This project demonstrates how to load an SVG file, extrude it into a 3D shape, and apply a dynamic, refractive glass material using React, Vite, and the React Three Fiber ecosystem. The result is a stunning, interactive 3D object with a "wobbly" glass distortion effect that refracts elements behind it in real-time.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **SVG to 3D Conversion:** Loads any SVG file and programmatically converts its paths into extruded 3D geometry.
*   **Advanced Glass Material:** Utilizes `MeshTransmissionMaterial` from `@react-three/drei` to create a realistic, refractive glass effect.
*   **Real-Time Customization:** Integrates the `leva` control panel to allow for real-time adjustments of geometry (scale, depth, edge roundness) and material properties (roughness, distortion, IOR, etc.).
*   **High-Quality Rendering:** Includes a "High Res" toggle to increase the polygon count for smoother, more detailed beveled edges.
*   **Dynamic Lighting & Reflections:** Uses an HDR environment map from `@react-three/drei` to produce high-quality, realistic lighting and reflections on the glass surface.

## üìö Core Libraries

This project is built upon a modern stack for creating 3D web experiences:

*   **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   **Vite:** A next-generation frontend tooling that provides a fast and lean development experience.
*   **Three.js:** The underlying 3D library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
*   **@react-three/fiber:** A React renderer for Three.js, which makes it easy to build 3D scenes declaratively with React components.
    *   **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)
    *   **Documentation:** [https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber)
*   **@react-three/drei:** A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for `@react-three/fiber`. This project uses it for the `MeshTransmissionMaterial`, `Environment`, and more.

    *   **Documentation:** [https://docs.pmnd.rs/drei/introduction](https://docs.pmnd.rs/drei/introduction)
*   **leva:** A GUI panel for React that allows you to easily add controls to your project, used here to tweak the 3D parameters in real-time.

## üîß How to Modify

### Changing the SVG Shape

The 3D model is generated from an SVG file. To use your own SVG:

1.  Place your SVG file in the `public/` directory. For example, `public/my-logo.svg`.
2.  Update the path in `src/GlassTorus.jsx` to load your new file:

    ```javascript
    // src/GlassTorus.jsx
    
    // Change this line to your SVG's filename
    const svgData = useLoader(SVGLoader, "/my-logo.svg"); 
    ```
    **Note:** For best results, use an SVG with closed paths and without complex fills or strokes.

### Customizing the Effect

A control panel will appear in the top-right corner of the screen when you run the application. You can use it to experiment with different looks in real-time. The controls are defined in `src/GlassTorus.jsx` and include:

*   **Geometry:** Adjust the `scale`, extrusion `depth`, and `Edge Roundness` of the 3D shape.
*   **Glass Material:** Modify properties like `thickness`, `roughness`, `transmission`, `ior` (Index of Refraction), `distortion`, and `temporalDistortion` to create unique glass effects.
*   **Quality:** Toggle the `High Res` option to switch between a low-poly and high-poly model.
